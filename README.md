# What is HTML?
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 as a standard for creating web pages. It's a markup language used to structure content on the web, defining elements like headings, paragraphs, links, and images. HTML forms the backbone of web content. In layman's terms, HTML is like the skeleton of a website. It's a set of instructions that tells a web browser how to display text, images, videos, and other elements on a webpage. Think of it as the building blocks that create the structure and look of a website, similar to how bricks and mortar are used to build a house.
# HTML Page Structure
An HTML document is structured using a set of nested tags. Each tag is enclosed within <..> angle brackets and acts as a container for content or other HTML tags. Let's take a look at a basic HTML document structure:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
   <!-- content -->
</body>
</html>

- The <!DOCTYPE html> tag specifies that the document is an HTML5 document.
- The <html lang="en"> tag defines the document to be in English.
- The <head> section contains metadata and the title of the webpage, which appears in the browser's title bar.
- The <body> section contains the content that will be displayed on the webpage.
